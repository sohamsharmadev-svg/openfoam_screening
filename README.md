# Binary Tree Package with YAML Support

This project implements a Binary Tree package in Python with YAML integration.  
Developed as part of the OpenFOAM screening task.

A modular Binary Tree implementation with YAML serialization designed for structured data storage and reconstruction. Built with clean architecture principles for scalability and maintainability.
